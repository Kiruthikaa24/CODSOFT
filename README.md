# TASK 1- Rule-Based Chatbot - Kitty

This project features **Kitty**, a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python. Designed for simple conversational interactions, the chatbot demonstrates how conditional logic and pattern matching can be used to simulate intelligent dialogue. It responds to greetings, jokes, motivational quotes, time queries, and more, making it a great beginner project to explore fundamental AI and NLP concepts.

## Project Overview

###  Features:
- Responds to user greetings and introductions
- Remembers user's name during conversation
- Shares:
  - Motivational quotes
  - Programming tips
  - Jokes and fun facts
- Provides current time
- Talks about its hobbies, favorite music, and colors
- Ends the conversation when the user types "bye", "exit", or "goodbye"

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Core Logic)
- **Regex** (Pattern Matching for Intent Detection)
- **Time** module (for showing current time)
- **Random** module (for random joke/quote selection)

# TASK 2- Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

This project is a Python-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where players compete against an **unbeatable AI**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to ensure optimal decision-making. Built with **Gradio**, the interface offers an interactive web-based experience, making this a perfect educational project for learning **game AI**, **search algorithms**, and **Python GUI development**.

---

## Project Features

- Single-player mode vs AI (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- Intuitive 3x3 grid built with Gradio interface
- AI always plays optimally and cannot be beaten
- Reset button to restart the game instantly
- Custom CSS for better UI (cell styling)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Gradio** - UI framework
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** - for AI logic
- **Custom CSS** - for cell styling

---

## Algorithm Explanation

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** enhanced with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:
- `Maximizing` player: AI (`0`)
- `Minimizing` player: Human (`X`)
- The AI evaluates all possible board states recursively and picks the best possible move.
- Pruning reduces unnecessary recursive calls and speeds up decision-making.
