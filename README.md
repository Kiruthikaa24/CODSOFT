# TASK 1- Rule-Based Chatbot - Kitty

This project features **Kitty**, a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python. Designed for simple conversational interactions, the chatbot demonstrates how conditional logic and pattern matching can be used to simulate intelligent dialogue. It responds to greetings, jokes, motivational quotes, time queries, and more, making it a great beginner project to explore fundamental AI and NLP concepts.

# TASK 2- Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

This project is a Python-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where players compete against an **unbeatable AI**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to ensure optimal decision-making. Built with **Gradio**, the interface offers an interactive web-based experience, making this a perfect educational project for learning **game AI**, **search algorithms**, and **Python GUI development**.

## Project Overview

### Features:

- Single-player mode vs AI (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- Intuitive 3x3 grid built with Gradio interface
- AI always plays optimally and cannot be beaten
- Reset button to restart the game instantly
- Custom CSS for better UI (cell styling)
